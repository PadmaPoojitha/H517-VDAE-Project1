# H517-VDAE-Project1

Dr. John Snow's map of London's 1854 cholera epidemic was a true master piece. It was the first time that anyone had established a link 
between contaminated water and cholera. The visualization provided compelling evidence and made the case for public health policies to 
improve water sanitation. The map remains one of the most remarkable and insightful visualizations ever created.

In this project, we will recreate Dr. John Snow's map using today's tools of trade (D3, to be specific). In addition to recreating the 
original map in an interactive version, we will add additional charts to the side of the map, as well as interface elements to make the 
data more interactive.
